# NBA_PPG_FGA_22
A Simple Regression Model in Python

This project aims to illustrate the relationship between NBA's top scorers and FGA stats (field goal attempts) for the NBA 2021-2022 season.

Using nba_api as a source of free stat database, the present exercise was used to practice Scitkit_learn data modelling, and, more specifically, a simple linear regression model was used.

Matplotlib was referred to as a final step for the visualisation of results.
